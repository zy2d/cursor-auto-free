## Configuration Instructions
- Use a Cloudflare domain email. Search for instructions if needed.  
- **(Very Important)** Use temp-mail.plus email. Search for instructions if needed.  
- Forward Cloudflare emails to temp-mail.plus.  
- Download the `.env.example` file to the program's root directory and rename it to `.env`.

### Example `.env` file:
```bash
DOMAIN='xxxxx.me'    # Your email domain (search for Cloudflare email usage)
TEMP_MAIL='xxxxxx'   # Temporary email prefix (no suffix needed)
```
Example:
```bash
DOMAIN='wozhangsan.me'
TEMP_MAIL='ccxxxxcxx'
```
The program will randomly generate emails with the `@wozhangsan.me` suffix.
