## Important Notes
1. **Ensure you have Chrome installed. If not, [download here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_pk/chrome/).**  
2. **You must log into your account, regardless of its validity. Logged-in is mandatory.**  
3. **A stable internet connection is required, preferably via an overseas node. Do not enable global proxy.**

## Configuration Instructions

### 1. tempmail.plus Email Forwarding
- Use a Cloudflare domain email. Search for instructions if needed.  
- **(Very Important)** Use tempmail.plus email. Search for instructions if needed.  
- Forward Cloudflare emails to tempmail.plus.  
- Download the `.env.example` file to the program's root directory and rename it to `.env`.

Example `.env` file:
```bash
DOMAIN='xxxxx.me'    # Your email domain (search for Cloudflare email usage)
TEMP_MAIL='xxxxxx'   # Temporary email, the target position you set in Cloudflare, using https://tempmail.plus/zh/#!
```
Example:
```bash
DOMAIN='wozhangsan.me'
TEMP_MAIL='ccxxxxcxx'
```
The program will randomly generate emails with the `@wozhangsan.me` suffix.

### 2. Using IMAP Instead of tempmail.plus
If you can't use tempmail.plus or prefer a more secure method to receive verification codes, you can configure like this:
```bash
DOMAIN='wozhangsan.me'
TEMP_MAIL=null

# IMAP server
IMAP_SERVER=imap.xxxxx.com
# IMAP SSL port
IMAP_PORT=993
# Email forwarded from CF
IMAP_USER=xxxxxx@xxxxx.com
# Email authorization code
IMAP_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# [Optional] Default is inbox
# You can set it to other folders where you can receive emails
IMAP_DIR=
```
